# These are tests for where comments may be located
# as well as the type of comments that may be parsed.
# A '#' denotes a single line comment, and will
# ignore everything on the line.
# '/#' denotes the start of a multi line comment
# if you want to use '#/' (the end of a multiline comment)
# inside of a multiline comment, use '#' at the start of the line
# to escape the whole line.

/#
    This is an example
    of a multiline comment.
#/

/#
#  This is also a multiline comment
#  however, you can use #/
#  inside of it because we have '#' at
#  the start of each line
#/

/##
#    This is an example of a doc comment.
#    It is a doc comment of a code block because it starts with '/##' instead of '/#'
#    and ends with '# ;' which ends the comment and opens a block.
#    This doc comment is on the main function
#/
/; main /# Comment inside function declaration #/ [int /# Comment inside this list of outputs #/ ]
