## Section 1 - Files

### Folder Structure

TNSL project structure has a root source folder with TNSL files contained within the folder and sub-folders.  There is no strictly enforced system, but good practice is to place code sub-modules in sub-folders, and name the module entry point file the same name as its enclosing folder.

The main file to compile is known as the root file, which generally resides in the root source folder.  This file will contain either a main method, or the pre-processor statement `rootfile` to denote the root of a library.  A main file may contain both.
